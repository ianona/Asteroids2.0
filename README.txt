----DESCRIPTION----

The application is a game patterned after the classic Atari space-shooter game, Asteroids. In the game, the player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field and the objective is to shoot incoming asteroids while avoiding collision with them as to assure the spaceship’s survival. For Asteroids 2.0, the movement of the spaceship will be controlled using motion sensors (gyroscope) while the shooting will be done via tapping. There will also be special power-ups that can be activated using touch gestures. For the user’s comfortability, the program will be vertically oriented, and the user has to move the device front, back, and sideways to maneuver through the map.

The flow of the game is, the user starts with main menu and touches start then the game proper happens. User had to survive longest as possible and the score will be in seconds on how long the user was able to survive the asteroids. It has basic menu buttons, and of course highscore and options to further customize the game.
